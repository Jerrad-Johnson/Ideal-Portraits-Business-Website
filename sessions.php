        <br />I am no longer offering studio sessions.

        <span class="headline2">SHORT SESSIONS</span>
        <span><b>30 minutes in my studio. $185</b>
        <br />Expect 2-4 images (not the usual 10-20).
        <br />You may want a short session if you only need a headshot, or for pictures of your young child that may grow restless.</span>

        <!--<span class="headline2">WHAT KINDS OF SHOOTS?</span>
        <span>Mostly, I only do sessions with individuals.

        <span class="headline2">GROUP HEADSHOTS</span>
        <span><b>$45 per person, plus a setup fee</b>
        <br />Large groups that can be ready for consecutive photos will receive a discount.</span>

        <!--
        <span class="headline2">CHILDREN</span>
        <span>Children are very active and need to use their bundle of energy, so especially with younger children, your child's pictures may be candid rather than posed.</span>

        <span class="headline2">PAYMENT AND IMPORTANT INFO.</span>
            <span>I do <b>not</b> charge extra for a digital copy (disc or zip) of the images, or for a print release. The session fee is due before you leave. All prices listed are <b>before tax.</b> I only accept cash and local checks, no credit cards.
        <br /><br />I do not offer refunds, unless your pictures are lost and I'm responsible for that. Once your pictures are delivered to you, I'm no longer responsible for them. However, I aim to always keep a copy.
        <br /><br />I want you to be happy with your pictures. If you feel that your pictures are unpleasing, please ask if I'll do a reshoot.
        <br /><br />You're free to post your pictures on the internet and have them printed somewhere else (ask me for a print release), but not to sell them or use them for ads.
        <br /><br />You'll have to sign a form (model release) acknowledging that I have full rights to the pictures; to reuse them in my portfolio, for example. If I'm working with a minor, a parent or legal guardian will have to sign the form. If the parent won't be present during the shoot, the form must be signed before the shoot; ask me to send a copy for you to print and sign. If you'd like to see this beforehand, please contact me.
        <br /><br />I have an adorable black lab mix that loves meeting new people. He's in my studio, which you should know in case you're allergic.
        <br /><br />If you're taller than about 5' 8" and we're working in studio, I'll have to take your pictures with you sitting.
        <br /><br />My goal is to have your pictures edited within two weeks. Typically, they're done within days. And if you need your pictures sooner, let me know your time frame before we do the shoot. Your pictures will likely have my business mark on them, which you can see in my galleries.
